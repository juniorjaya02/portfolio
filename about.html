<h4>EXPERIENCE</h4>
<h5>2 month internship at RAJAPRATHEEPAN & Co, Chartered Accountants</h5>
âœ¨ I recently completed my internship at RAJAPRATHEEPAN & Co, Chartered Accountants from 2nd May to 5th July 2025 as part of my second-year project work. During this period, I gained practical exposure to auditing, accounting, taxation, and various financial procedures. Working under experienced professionals helped me develop strong analytical and technical skills, as well as improve my teamwork and communication abilities. I had the opportunity to understand how theoretical concepts are applied in real-world situations and to learn about client interactions and professional ethics. I am grateful for the guidance and support I received throughout this valuable learning journey.

  <H4>EVENT MANAGEMENT</H4>
I served as the student coordinator for the university-level Euphoria and Vintra Adzap events, which were inter-college competitions involving participants from various institutions. I was actively involved in planning, organizing, and managing the events from start to finish. Coordinating with multiple teams, handling logistics, and ensuring smooth execution helped me develop strong leadership and communication skills. I learned to manage time efficiently, solve problems quickly, and lead a team with confidence. This experience greatly enhanced my ability to take responsibility, make decisions under pressure, and work collaboratively, contributing significantly to my personal and professional growth as a student leader.
